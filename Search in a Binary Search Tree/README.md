# Search in a Binary Search Tree

## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and an integer `val`.

Your task is to find the node whose value is equal to `val` and return the **subtree rooted at that node**.

If no such node exists in the BST, return `null`.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**
```
root = [4,2,7,1,3]
val = 2
```

**Output**
```
[2,1,3]
```

---

### Example 2

**Input**
```
root = [4,2,7,1,3]
val = 5
```

**Output**
```
[]
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range **[1, 5000]**.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^7`
- The given tree is a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**.
- `1 <= val <= 10^7`
